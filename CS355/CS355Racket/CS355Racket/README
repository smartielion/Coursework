This rkt file is opened in racket and provides an implementation of olinvg 3-sat problems using the hill climb method

to test run and type replacing # with 1,2,3 or make your own
(simple-hill-climb clauses# teststate 1000 (unsat-clauses clauses# teststate)))
this will output its best try at a solution for the clauses

You can check if it is an actual solution by running 
(unsat-clauses clauses# statefinal#)
where statefinal is the returned state (must be defined by user)

if this returns an empty list, the state is a solution
